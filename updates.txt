Thanks for that important clarification! This helps me understand the workflow better. Let me refine my understanding of how the system should work:

## Refined Understanding of Campaign Workflow

1. **Email Sending Process**:

1. Users have their own Email Service Provider (ESP) like Mailchimp, Constant Contact, etc.
2. They create and send their email campaigns through that ESP
3. They target the seed list emails that are stored in our system



2. **Tracking Process**:

1. After sending the campaign from their ESP to the seed list
2. Recipients (seed list members) receive the email in their inboxes
3. Recipients forward these emails to our system's inbox address
4. Our system processes these forwards to determine delivery success and inbox placement



3. **What We're Tracking**:

1. We're not sending emails ourselves
2. We're tracking whether emails sent by the client's ESP reached the seed list members
3. We're analyzing where those emails landed (inbox, spam, promotions, etc.)
4. We're calculating delivery rates and other metrics based on what was forwarded to us





## Key Components Needed

1. **Seed List Management** (which we've already implemented):

1. Store and manage the list of seed email addresses
2. Allow export of this list so users can import it into their ESP



2. **Email Receiving System**:

1. A dedicated email address that receives forwards from seed list members
2. A way to process these incoming emails (either through API, IMAP/POP3, or manual upload)



3. **Email Analysis**:

1. Parse forwarded emails to extract original headers and content
2. Identify which campaign they belong to
3. Determine which seed list member forwarded it
4. Analyze email headers to determine inbox placement



4. **Campaign Tracking**:

1. Group forwards into campaigns
2. Calculate delivery rates
3. Track performance across different email providers





## Implementation Considerations

1. **Email Processing Options**:

1. **Dedicated Email Account**: Set up an email account that our application can access via IMAP/POP3
2. **Email Forwarding Service**: Use a service that can receive emails and forward them to our API
3. **Manual Upload**: Allow admins to upload EML files or forward emails manually



2. **Campaign Identification**:

1. Use subject lines, sender information, or custom tracking codes to group emails into campaigns
2. Consider how to handle variations in subject lines or forwarding formats



3. **Inbox Placement Detection**:

1. Analyze email headers to determine if the original email landed in inbox, spam, or promotional folders
2. This might require specific instructions to seed list members on how to forward emails





## Questions to Consider

1. **Email Processing Method**:

1. How will the system receive and process forwarded emails?
2. Will this be automated or manual?



2. **Campaign Identification**:

1. How will the system identify which campaign a forwarded email belongs to?
2. Will users need to add specific identifiers to their email subjects?



3. **Forwarding Instructions**:

1. What specific instructions will seed list members need to follow when forwarding emails?
2. Do they need to preserve headers or use specific forwarding methods?



4. **Reporting Requirements**:

1. What specific metrics and reports are most important to users?
2. How detailed should the campaign analysis be?





Would you like to discuss any of these aspects in more detail before we start implementing the code?
